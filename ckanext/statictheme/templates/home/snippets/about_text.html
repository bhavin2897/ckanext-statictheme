    <h2> NFDI4Chem Search Service </h2>

    <p>
    The NFDI4Chem Search Service provides centralized access to overarching datasets and search results from various chemistry
    and chemistry-related repositories within the NFDI4Chem federation. One can browse through these datasets and optimize your search results
    by various filter options. The NFDI4Chem Search Service is developed and maintained by
    <a href="https://www.tib.eu/en/">TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology. </a>
    It is part of the service portfolio of the <a href="https://www.nfdi4chem.de/">NFDI4Chem consortium </a> within the
    <a href = "https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en">National Research Data Infrastructure. </a>
    </p>

    <p>
    The Search Service currently harvests and indexes metadata from the following repositories:

    <h3> Chemotion - Repository for Molecules and Research Data </h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome"> Chemotion - Repository </a>
        covers research data assigned to molecules, their properties and characterization, as well as reactions and
        experimental investigations. It is hosted at the <a href = 'https://www.kit.edu/english/'> Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) </a>
        and is used by several groups in Germany and beyond. Scientists in the field of molecular and synthetic chemistry are supported in their
        efforts to handle data in a FAIR (<b>F</b>indable, <b>A</b>ccessible, <b>I</b>nteroperable & <b>R</b>eusable) manner.
        The repository is interoperable with the <a href ='https://eln.chemotion.net/home'> Chemotion Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) </a>,
        which means that data can be transferred from the ELN directly to the repository.
        Data is curated through <a href ='https://www.chemotion-repository.net/home/howto/c40fdb44-8854-46bf-88b3-cc9d6adc3543'> automatic checks </a>
        and a peer review process. The Chemotion repository provides an internal substance register, a spectra viewer (ChemSpectra), a structure editor (Ketcher),
        and accepts all data types, while only a few of them can be processed and edited in the viewers.

    <h3> MassBank - High Quality Mass Spectral Database </h3>
    <p>
        <a href = "https://massbank.eu/MassBank/">MassBank </a> is an open source mass spectral library for the identification of small chemical molecules of metabolomics, exposomics and environmental
        relevance. The vast majority of MassBank <a href="https://massbank.eu/MassBank/Contents"> contents </a> now features high-resolution mass spectrometry data, although all kinds of mass spectral data
        are accepted. A range of <a href= "https://massbank.eu/MassBank/Search"> search </a> options are available for browsing the data.
        The MassBank library is based on <a href = "https://github.com/MassBank/MassBank-data"> text file records </a> containing the record metadata
        and the mass spectral information in the <a href="https://github.com/MassBank/MassBank-web/blob/main/Documentation/MassBankRecordFormat.md"> MassBank record format.</a>
        All data is archived on <a href = "https://github.com/MassBank/MassBank-data"> GitHub </a> and <a href = "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3378723"> Zenodo</a>;
        the code is also on <a href= "https://github.com/MassBank/"> GitHub</a>. The MassBank library can be <a href = "https://github.com/MassBank/MassBank-data/releases"> downloaded in different formats such as text
        records, database files (sql) and MSP files.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        MassBank is maintained and developed by the <a href = "https://github.com/MassBank"> MassBank consortium </a> and is supported by
        the <a href= "https://www.norman-network.net/"> NORMAN Association </a>, <a href = "https://www.fnr.lu/"> FNR </a> and NFDI4Chem.
        The main sustainers and developers of MassBank and related tools are the Team of Steffen Neumann

    <h3> nmrXiv </h3>

    <p>
        <a href="https://nmrxiv.org/"> nmrXiv </a> is a FAIR and Open, Consensus-Driven Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data Repository and Computational platform. It is currently being developed as a part of NFDI4Chem initiative with the ultimate goal of accelerating broader coordination and data sharing among researchers by creating a platform for managing, sharing, and analyzing raw and processed NMR spectral data.
        The immediate goal of nmrXiv is to integrate and execute the following objectives by establishing nmrXiv as a consensus-driven resource designed to serve global chemistry research and adjacent natural products / metabolomics communities.
